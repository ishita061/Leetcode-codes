70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n <= 2) {
            return n;
        }
        int first_step=1;
        int second_step=2;
        for(int i = 3;i <= n;i ++) {
            int third_step = first_step+second_step;
            first_step = second_step;
            second_step = third_step;
        }
        return second_step;
    }
}
